        <div class="main__wrapper">
        <p>All web developers should be familiar with the basics of web security. There are plenty of naughty, little rascals who want to mess up our stuff. Some of them simply want to take down your site for the hell of it. Others are trying to ransom your data, meaning they lock you out of your system and want a payment to open it up again. Sometimes they'll take over your site and redirect your users to another website (think "adult sites"). I've had that happen to me once; I can tell you it wasn't fun.</p>
        <p>But then there as these who try to access some private data and somehow profit from using that info. Websites that handle sensitive user data should be especially careful with their security. You wouldn't want to be responsible for your user's private stuff to end up in the wrong hands!</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rkx6Lz6rDNc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>So security is both important to you - and your users! In this article I'll be taking a look at some of the most important security measures to take with your websites.</p>
        <p>Before I move on to the juicy stuff I'd like to mention one thing. If you are using a good hosting provider and/or a popular CMS like Wordpress or Drupal, many of these things are already have these things setup. At least the basics of them. There was some trend that web developers would argue that Wordpress wasn't really safe, but I think that has changed now. It's huge community provides frequent security-update (as well a feature-updates) so security holes are patch pretty fast. Being open-source and widely used many eyes are looking at its code and that means holes will be spotted early on compared to proprietary software.</p>
        <p>But that doesn't mean you should just plug the machine and not consider if these things are intact. Some of them will need setup even though you are using a good hosting provider and a good CMS.</p>
        <p>I also can't stretch the importance of keeping your software up-to-date. Take it from me: if I'd updated my Drupal installation earlier, my website wouldn't have changed from being a hotel's website to a pornsite. I'm always surprise to see how many people ignore software update - even system updates on their own personal mobile or desktop devices. I know Drupal and Wordpress both have a feature to send you an e-mail once an update is availeble.</p>
        <h2>HTTPS & SSL</h2>
        <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure or simply HTTPS is an extension of the original HTTP. It was actually created in 1994 by Netscape Navigator (you remember Netscape?) but it's adoption was pretty slow. It really wasn't until Google announced in 2018 that HTTP websites would be marked as "Not secure" in the Chrome browser, and that those websites would be ranked lower in their search engine in terms of SEO.</p>
        <p>But does HTTPS do? Well, it's a protocol that ensures privacy between the user and the website (or server) that are communicating. It does so by encrypting all data that are passed back-and-forth to protect the user from someone "listening" or modifying what is being sent to and from the server. It's a technology that protects the users identity, keep its web browsing private and verifies the page's authenticity.</p>
        <p>To ensure all of this, a digital certificate is created for that particular website and a third-party provider (or a certificate authority) signs it for authentication. The third par There are two protocols that HTTPS can use: SSL (stands for Secure Socket Layer) or TSL (Transport Layer Security), the later one being the more recent method.</p>
        <p>Initially, setting up HTTPS and installing SSL used to be expensive and cumbersome, so it was mainly used for stuff like payment gateways, banking apps or other big corporation websites. In the recent year this has changed after the EFF digital rights group pushed for a larger adoption of HTTPS with the help of browser developers.</p>
        <p>Today most respectable hosting provides will actually provide you with a SSL certificate and setup for free. Many of the use "Let's Encrypt" which is a non-profit certificate authority. To use Let's Encrypt, you'll get a certificate from them and demonstrate that you in fact have control over this particular server using ACME protocol software. You'll need SSH access to your server to set this up yourself. If you don't have shell access you'll need to contact your hosting provider. They could either open up for shell access - or better yet offer built in support for this. That way the provider will automate getting a certificate on your behalf, install it and keep it up-to-date. I've used <a href="https://.1984.is">1984.is</a> for many of my website; they offer this functionality and it's 100% hassle-free. Just click the button and you're good to go! </p>
        <h2>Firewall</h2>
        <p>Firewall - sounds like something from the table-top RPG Dungeons and Dragons. But it's a good name for what it is; a spell to keep nasty, goblins at bay. But it's actually named after walls in buildings that protect rooms incase of a fire so it doesn't spread or at least spreads slower so people can get the hell out of there.</p>
        <p>Firewalls block unwanted, incoming and outgoing traffic to and from your machine. For the firewall to work you'll need to specify which traffic is unwanted. It can both be setup on WiFi-routers as well at an OS level. For that you create was is called "rules" and specify what you don't like - or like. It's easier to understand what unwanted traffic means but what is wanted traffic? That's something that might blocked by default in the firewall; on both macOs and Windows you're often requested to give certain programs an exemption from your firewall settings. Traffic can be blocked with various definitions, such as IP-address, ports, users, user-groups, URLs.</p>
        <p>Using a firewall can often be the most easy solution to prevent a security breach on your server. You can add well known harmful IP-addresses or networks to it so. If you get a DDOS attack, you can create a rule to block that particular hacker. Likewise, if you see some suspicious outgoing traffic from your machine you can also block that. Being the privacy nerd I am, I rarely allow outgoing traffic from the applications on my computer unless it's crucial for that program to provide to phone home and be useful for me. </p>
        <p>I'm not gonna go into detail on how to configure a firewall; it can be a complex task and in certain scenarios, rules can actually be harmful if not setup correctly. There are plenty of people who will teach you how to do this properly online.</p>

        <h2>CORS</h2>
        <p>We as web-dev students have probably seen something called Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in the console; and usually that has broken our website. Well, damn you Cross-Origin Resource Sharing! What do you want!?</p>
        <p>Like all-things-online, someone found an easier name to call it: CORS. But that long name tries to explain what it is: it's when two or more web spaces are sharing a resource, be it scripts, images, videos, stylesheets. But why wouldn't mbl.is not be allowed to use a script from <a href=""evil.com>evil.com?</a> Actually, please don't visit that site ... It's not HTTPS. But it does in fact make sense. You're accessing that "respectable" site you think you can trust and the average user is not thinking much about what might be happening in the background. But let's say mbl.is is actually using some script from evil.com that could be very harmful to their computer or privacy.</p>
        <p>CORS is enforced by web-browsers and all modern web-browsers enforce it. If parts of your website is being block because of CORS, you'll either:</p>
